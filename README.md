## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
This repository provides guidance on completing the ASIC design flow from scratch, using the RISC-V architecture. Learn how to go from high-level languages to physical layout.

## <a name="flow-overview"></a>Flow Overview
1. **HLL (High-Level Language)**: Understand the basics of high-level programming languages such as C and C++.
2. **ALP (Assembly Level Program)**: Dive into assembly language programming and its importance in CPU architecture.
3. **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**: Explore hardware description languages like Verilog, System Verilog, and VHDL for designing digital circuits.
4. **GDS (Graphic Data System)**: Learn about layout design using tools like Klayout and Magic.

## <a name="tools-and-prerequisites"></a>Tools and Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary tools and prerequisites installed on your system. You can follow the provided installation script to set up the required environment. The installation script is provided in the [run_ubuntu.sh](./run_ubuntu.sh) file.
