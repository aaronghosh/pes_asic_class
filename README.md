## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
This repository will contain files that will help in completing the ASIC design flow from scratch, using the RISC-V architecture. Learn how to go from high-level languages to physical layout.

## <a name="flow-overview"></a>Flow Overview
1. **HLL (High-Level Language)**: Understand the basics of high-level programming languages such as C and C++.
2. **ALP (Assembly Level Program)**: Dive into assembly language programming and its importance in CPU architecture.
3. **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**: Explore hardware description languages like Verilog, System Verilog, and VHDL for designing digital circuits.
4. **GDS (Graphic Data System)**: Learn about layout design using tools like Klayout and Magic.

## <a name="tools-and-prerequisites"></a>Tools and Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary tools and prerequisites installed on your system. You can follow the provided installation script to set up the required environment. The installation script is provided in the [run_ubuntu.sh](./run_ubuntu.sh) file.

### <a name="day-1-introduction-to-riscv-isa-and-gnu-compiler-toolchain"></a>Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain
- Learnt about Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and its importance in CPU functionality.
- Understood the RISC-V ISA, an open-source and customizable instruction set.
- Explored various extensions in the RISC-V ISA, such as integer, floating-point, and atomic instructions.
- Compiled and executed programs using both C compiler and RISC-V compiler.

### <a name="day-2-introduction-to-abi-and-basic-verification-flow"></a>Day 2: Introduction to ABI and Basic Verification Flow
- Dove into Application Binary Interface (ABI) and its role in software-hardware interaction.
- Discovered the basics of verification flow and how it ensures proper design functionality.
- Explored compressed instruction formats that optimize code size while maintaining functionality.
- Learnt about supervisor-level instructions for managing system operations.
